# 🎉 **FINQUEST - GOAL COUNT & MONEY ICONS FIXED!**

## ✅ **DYNAMIC GOAL COUNT & CONTROLLED MONEY ICONS!**

I have successfully fixed both issues: the goal count now updates based on active goals, and the money icons are now properly controlled and limited.

## 🚀 **ISSUES FIXED:**

### ✅ **1. Dynamic Goal Count**
- **Problem**: Goal count was hardcoded as "3" and didn't update
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `id="activeGoalsCount"` to the goal count element
  - Updated `loadGoals()` function to count active goals dynamically
  - Added filtering logic to count only goals with `status === 'active'`
- **Result**: Goal count now updates automatically based on actual active goals

### ✅ **2. Money Icons Control**
- **Problem**: Continuous money icons (💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰) were showing at the bottom
- **Solution**: 
  - Limited money icons to maximum of 10 per streak
  - Added `flex-wrap` to prevent overflow
  - Limited grayed-out icons to maximum of 5
  - Added "+X" indicator for streaks longer than 10 days
- **Result**: Money icons are now properly contained and controlled

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL FIXES:**

### **✅ Dynamic Goal Count**
```javascript
// Update active goals count
const activeGoalsCount = goals.filter(goal => goal.status === 'active').length;
const countElement = document.getElementById('activeGoalsCount');
if (countElement) {
    countElement.textContent = activeGoalsCount;
}
```

### **✅ Controlled Money Icons**
```javascript
// Limited money icons with proper wrapping
<div class="flex items-center space-x-1 flex-wrap">
    ${Array.from({length: Math.min(streak.currentStreak, 10)}, (_, i) => 
        `<span class="text-xs">💰</span>`
    ).join('')}
    ${Array.from({length: Math.max(0, Math.min(10 - streak.currentStreak, 5))}, (_, i) => 
        `<span class="text-xs text-gray-300">💰</span>`
    ).join('')}
    ${streak.currentStreak > 10 ? `<span class="text-xs text-gray-500">+${streak.currentStreak - 10}</span>` : ''}
</div>
```
